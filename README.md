### 🚨 FIXED GRADLE CI ERROR

Standard GitHub runners sometimes use Gradle 9.x which is incompatible with current Android plugins. 
This project's CI configuration has been updated to **explicitly force Gradle 8.4**.

**HOW TO UPLOAD:**
Upload all files to the **ROOT** of your repository. 
The files `build.gradle` and `gradlew` must be at the top level.
