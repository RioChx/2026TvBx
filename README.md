# TV Floating Widget Project

### 🚨 IN WHICH PATH? (IMPORTANT)

Upload the files to the **ROOT** of your repository. 

**DO NOT** create a folder named "TVFloatingWidget" or "project" inside the repo.
The file `build.gradle` must be visible immediately when you open your repository page.

### Correct Structure (ROOT):
```text
github.com/username/my-repo/
  ├── .github/workflows/android.yml
  ├── build.gradle
  ├── settings.gradle
  └── app/
```
